1. Compare kern/mpentry.S side by side with boot/boot.S. Bearing in mind that 
   kern/mpentry.S is compiled and linked to run above KERNBASE just like 
   everything else in the kernel, what is the purpose of macro MPBOOTPHYS? Why 
   is it necessary in kern/mpentry.S but not in boot/boot.S? In other words, 
   what could go wrong if it were omitted in kern/mpentry.S?
   
   #define MPBOOTPYS(s) ((s) - mpentry_start + MPENTRY_PADDR)
   MPBOOTPHYS is used to calculate the load address of a symbol
 
   In boot.S, load addresses are identical to link addresses; but in mpentry.S
   they are not.
